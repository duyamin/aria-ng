ARIA
====

ARIA is a platform and a set of tools for building TOSCA-based products, such as orchestrators.
Its features can be accessed via a well-documented Python API, as well as a language-agnostic
RESTful API that can be deployed as a microservice.

On its own, ARIA provides built-in tools for blueprint validation and for creating ready-to-run
service instances.
